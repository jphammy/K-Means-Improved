K-Means Clustering: Python Implementation to Improve Accurary of K

We implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python to resolve the 'randomness' of the K clustering problem.
Our code finds the optimal amount of clusters, K. Google Colabs was used to run our code. 

This folder includes: 
1) 3 .csv files for testing that was altered from a linked list to a 2-dimensional array
2) Python source code
3) 3 pdf files with corresponding screenshots of graphical results

After obtaining the optimal K from this code, we could in turn use these results to run our C++ code to find
the time to execute both our K-Means and K-Means Improved codes.
